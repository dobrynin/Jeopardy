# Jeopardy
This project scrapes and parses "Jeopardy!" HTML data from j-archive.com and stores them in SQL database. The data are then analyzed, converted into JSON format, and supplied to the a D3.js program which creates a visualization showing "connections" between the retrieved Jeopardy Categories. A simple, text-based Jeopardy game is also included.
